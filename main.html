			<h3 class="st neu" style="text-align: right;">Just Me and My Sea Monkeys<br>— Claire Aubin<br><br>
				I was in love and in lockdown in a small flat in Leith, Scotland. I had a lot of feelings and nowhere to
				put them. So I bought sea monkeys. I poured in the powder and checked the water temperature. For weeks,
				nothing. My last-ditch effort at finding something small (and within the rental agreement) to nurture
				was pointless. But then, so small you could barely make them out, a glimmer of hope and companionship in
				two tiny wriggling specks.

			<h3 class="st neu" style="text-align: left;">Without Him<br>— Deirdre Stein<br><br>
				After dinner this March, my 28-year-old son decided to leave this world. He left me his cat. I didn’t
				want his cat; I wanted him. His cat didn’t want me; she wanted him. She cries all night. I cry all day.
				She sneaks into his bedroom to look for him; so do I. She smells his sheets; so do I. She waits by the
				front door; so do I. We’ve learned to find comfort in each other. We snuggle, sleep and mourn together.
				I had a beautiful boy named Elias. Now I have a beautiful cat named Damie.

				Magic in Manila<br>— Rowena Leong Singer<br><br>
				At 5, I believed that my father could perform magic. In Manila’s moist heat, he drove in stop-and-go
				traffic with five screaming children and a broken AC. If we were very quiet, he said, he would use his
				powers to make the billboard flip screens. We quieted and he chanted an incantation, waved his hand,
				then flicked his fingers in perfect sync with the billboard change. Goosebumps peppered my arms.

			<h3 class="st neu" style="text-align: left;">Greeting the Seasonal Guests<br>— Gloria Barone Rosanio<br><br>
				Twenty-nine years ago, my mother upstaged Jesus by dying right before Christmas. I was a single mother
				of a 4-year-old. I made the season merry for my daughter, though inside I felt like the sun would never
				shine. Over the years, I accepted that sadness would arrive around December. I greeted it at the door
				with a cocktail in hand — recently, with a pot of coffee. Sad and happy memories will always sit
				together at my holiday table, like restless houseguests.

			<h3 class="st neu" style="text-align: right;">Breakup, a Bomb Threat and a Renewed Trust in Love<br>— Jay
				Rappaport<br><br>
				We met during a bomb threat. I exited the D.C. metro to see yellow tape blocking my street. She asked me
				if I knew what happened. I said no. She asked me to dinner. With time to kill before I could enter my
				building, I said yes. She was blonde, Christian and a Red Sox fan: a Holy Trinity of forbidden fruit for
				me, son of New York’s Upper West Side. (We also understood each other’s jokes too late.)
			</h3>
			<h3 class="st neu" style="text-align: left;">A Warm Cup in Our Camper<br>— Amanda<br><br>
				He brings me coffee in bed every morning. It’s far from the dreamy depiction of romantic comedies — not
				in an apartment with a city view or a house tucked in a cul-de-sac, but in the frigid cold of our tiny
				camper, where I sit, barely awake, swimming in a sea of blankets. We live in a camper in the Kentucky
				woods to keep from being homeless. For me, he wakes early to make coffee in an old-fashioned teakettle
				on the fire outside.
